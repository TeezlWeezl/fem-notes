  Types & Coercion
    Primitive Types
    00:06:57: undefined is a variable in an uninitialized state while null is often used as a 
              placeholder to signify the absence of an object or value

typeof null still 
              returns "object" which is a bug in JS that can't be fixed any more

    NaN
    00:01:43: NaN is a special value that sort of indicates that there was an invalid 
              mathematical operation

    new
    00:00:47: If we call String, Number, Boolean with a value it changes it into that type. 
              Don't use new for type coercion

    Equality
    00:00:48: == allows coercion
=== doesn't allow coercion

  Scope
    Undefined vs Undeclared
    00:00:34: Undeclared = Variable that never has been declared anywhere (gives Reference 
              Error: variable has not been defined)

Undefinded = Variable was declared but 
              never defined / initialized

    Function Expressions
    00:01:45: Anonymous function expression:

let myFunc = function(){...}

Named function 
              expression: 
function myFunc() {...}

  this & Prototypes
    Prototypes
    00:01:17: Prototype means that it is an object where any instances are going to be linked 
              to or delegated to.
