CSS Foundations
  CSS Basics
    Fonts & Typography
    00:00:19: It's good practice to set quotation marks for font families that have a white 
              space
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/fonts-typography?t=19
    
    00:07:30: em and rem will scale depending on the users default fonts size, while pixels 
              will not

  Project
    Landing Page CSS & HTML
    00:09:18: When downloading fonts they must be added using @font-face declaration in the 
              css file

  Layout
    Combinators
    00:02:44: Adjacent Sibling Combinator: h1 + p -> Sibling under the same parent (only first 
              one)
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/combinators?t=164
    
    00:04:04: General Sibling combinator: p ~ code -> Siblings under the same parent (all)
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/combinators?t=244
    
    00:08:41: Grid vs Flexbox: Flexbox is used for one dimensional layouts while grid is used 
              for multidimensional layouts
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/combinators?t=521
    
    Block Element Modifier (BEM)
    00:00:58: BEM (naming convention for classes)

Block: Standalone entity that is meaningful 
              on its own

e.g. header menu input

Element: Part of a block, not necessarily 
              needs to have an own meaning

e.g. Menu item, list item, header title

Modifier: 
              Something that modefies the element

e.g. disabled highlighted checked 
              etc.

.block__element--modifier

    The Box Model
    00:02:00: Standard box model uses width + padding + border, so e.g. defining the width 
              will not give you the "real" width of the box

Therefore in most cases you use 
              the "alternative" box model which is box-sizing: border-box
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/the-box-model?t=120
    
    Z-Index & Positioning
    00:04:41: In order to position an element with position relative correctly its parent must 
              be position relative as well
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/z-index-positioning?t=281
    
    00:08:08: Position fixed is always on the same spot while scrolling

Position sticky will 
              stop after it reaches the end of its parent container
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/z-index-positioning?t=488
    
    Pseudo Classes, Elements & Transitions
    00:05:37: Transition declarations: 
              

transition-property
transition-duration
transition-timing-function

Can be 
              used in one transition declaration: 

e.g. transition: background .2s ease-in
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/pseudo-classes-elements-transitions?t=337
    
  Interactive & Responsive UI
    Home Page Layout
    00:05:46: For semantic reasons it can be useful to declare a variable in the :root that is 
              using another variable
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/home-page-layout?t=346
    
    Styling Interactive Buttons
    00:05:41: margin-inline-end defines the logical inline end margin of an element, which 
              maps to a physical margin depending on the element's writing mode, 
              directionality, and text orientation. (MDN)
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/styling-interactive-buttons?t=341
    
    00:07:10: The vertical-align CSS property sets vertical alignment of an inline, 
              inline-block or table-cell box. (MDN)

It is possible to vertically align with 
              flexbox but if possible it is recommended to avoid that for "smaller" things
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/styling-interactive-buttons?t=430
    
    00:09:55: The outline property in CSS draws a line around the outside of an element. 
              It’s similar to border except that:

It always goes around all the sides, you 
              can’t specify particular sides
It’s not a part of the box model, so it 
              won’t affect the position of the element or adjacent elements (nice for 
              debugging!)
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/styling-interactive-buttons?t=595
    
    Align Items Q&A
    00:04:58: align-iteme: baseline => items are aligned such as their baselines align
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/align-items-q-a?t=298
    
    Speakers Image & Grid Layout
    00:01:03: VS Code hack: Cmd+D adds multi-cursor at the next item that matches selection
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/speakers-image-grid-layout?t=63
    
    00:06:57: Images with a defined width and height can be distorted. Use object-fit (parent) 
              and object-position (child) to fix those.
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/speakers-image-grid-layout?t=417
    
    00:07:45: instead of @media(min-width: 1000px) one can also use @media(width < 1000px), 
              which is easier to read
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/speakers-image-grid-layout?t=465
    
    Mobile Header Layout
    00:02:35: display: none will remove item from the DOM while visibility: hidden will just 
              hide it, but it's still in the DOM
              https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-foundations/mobile-header-layout?t=155
